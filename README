Utility scripts to make it easier to move large(ish) sites around on RS CloudSites.

Upload the script to your webserver, hit it with a url and then retrieve the site archive.

Notes

These scripts require the CloudSite to use PHP as it's underlying technology.

** WARNING
** USE THESE SCRIPTS AT YOUR OWN RISK
** IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, DON'T USE THEM
